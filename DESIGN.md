*1) Searching the database using the Rijksmuseum API*  
I should be able to figure out how to implement this with the [documentation](http://rijksmuseum.github.io/) and [demos](http://rijksmuseum.github.io/demos/) provided by the Rijksmuseum.  
The API response will be in JSON, I have found a [tutorial](http://mobilesiri.com/json-parsing-in-android-using-android-studio/) that explains how to parse this in Android Studio.

*2) Selecting one image and downloading it to the Android device*  
The UI should facilitate scrolling through the images retrieved by a searchquery. Then the user should be able to select one image to view it full screen and see more information. When the user wants to edit the image, the images should (probably) be downloaded to the android device. 

*3) Editing the selected image by adding text*  
I plan to code this functionality myself. I have found [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11318205/how-to-write-text-on-an-image-in-java-android) on Stack Overflow that gives some explanation on how this could be implemented.

*4) A "Share Activity" that facilitates sharing the image to the web and other apps already installed on the Android device*  
For the sharing of the images I plan to use an option already implemented in Android: the "Share Intent". Sending an image to this intent will show [all the apps](http://i0.wp.com/www.devcfgc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/intent-chooser.jpg) already installed on the Android device that facilitate uploading/sharing images.
