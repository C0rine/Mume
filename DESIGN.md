**Permissions**  
We need internet to make connection to the internet, we need to get permission for this in the Android Manifest file:  
```<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>```

### Advanced Sketches UI

### Classes and Public Methods

### API implementation
####1) Connection to the search activity####
The search activity will have a searchbar the searchwords used in this bar will be provided to the API.  
Example query: ```https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/en/collection?q=Q&imgonly=True&key=fakekey&format=json```  
**Input for the query:**
- **/en**: language  
- **/collection**: we will search the collection   
- **?q=Q**: Q is the searchword provided by the user  
- **&imgonly=true**: we only want records of artworks that also have images in their record  
- **&key=fakekey**: fakekey gets replaced by my api key  
- **&format=json**: we will retrieve the results in json  

**Information that I want to show in the results-activity:**
- "principalOrFirstMaker" --> We use the name of the (principal) maker since it is short. Artwork titles would be too long.
- An image/thumbnail of the artwork --> can be found via another query:  ```https://rijksmuseum.nl/api/nl/collection/SK-C-5/tiles?key=fakekey&format=json```. This API returns a list of levels. These levels have a number of tiles. The tiles form the complete image. You can choose the right level by using the width and height. They describe the total resolution of the chosen level. You can also select a level by name. Level z0 contains the largest available image and z6 the smallest. The sizes of the z levels differ considarably so I think I would be best off by selecting a level based on width.
  
####2) Selecting one artwork####
When the user taps one artwork the objectNumber of that artwork should be retrieved and a new query should be made:  
https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/en/collection/objnum?key=fakekey&format=json  
**objnum**: object number (i.e. SK-C-5)

**Information I want to show in the select-activity:**
- "title"
- "principalMakers" : "name"
- "dating" : [] 
- "materials" : [] 
- Also add a button to the Rijksmuseum webpage record of this image for more information. This could be sent from the previous activity ("links" : "web") or found in this activity by adding "links" : "search" to "objectNumber". 


####3) Editing the artwork####
The image should be saved to the Android device in bitmap format for editing. Downloading: http://javatechig.com/android/download-image-using-asynctask-in-android
