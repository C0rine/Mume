This app was test on a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime (SM-G361F) and HTC ONE mini.

#### Summary:
Mume (MUseum MEmes) is an Android App that uses images from the databases of museums (for this project only the database of the Rijksmuseum will be used) to create memes. 

Based on the popular Facebook-page: https://www.facebook.com/classicalartmemes  

*User gap: to facilitate making and sharing Classical Art Memes.*  
*Underlying idea: introduce art history more into popular-/webculture.*  

Features:
- Search through (Rijks)museum artworks and retrieve individual images of the artworks.
- Edit these images by adding text, drawing on them and/or cropping them.
- Share these images online or with friends through apps already installed on the Android device.
- View the latest memes of the [Classical Art Memes](https://www.facebook.com/classicalartmemes) Facebook page.

### Datasources  
For this project I have chosen the database of the Rijksmuseum since they provide a clear API with plenty documentation and examples. Moreover: "All data and all images made available through the API are either in the public domain or are subject to a CC0 license. The data and images are royalty-free and may be copied, distributed, modified and used without the permission of the Rijksmuseum.". More information on the API: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api.
