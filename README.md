#### Platform: Android Studio

#### To run:
- Open the project in Android Studio
- This app uses Volley (https://github.com/mcxiaoke/android-volley)
  
Mume (MUseum MEmes) will be an Android App that uses images from the databases of museums (for this project only the database of the Rijksmuseum will be used) to create memes. 

Based on the popular Facebook-page: https://www.facebook.com/classicalartmemes  

*User gap: to facilitate making and sharing Classical Art Memes.*  
*Underlying idea: introduce art history more into popular-/webculture.*  

### Features
- Search through (Rijks)museum artworks and retrieve individual images of the artworks
- Add text to these images
- Share these images online or with friends through apps already installed on the Android device

### Datasources  
For this project I have chosen the database of the Rijksmuseum since they provide a clear API with plenty documentation and examples. Moreover: "All data and all images made available through the API are either in the public domain or are subject to a CC0 license. The data and images are royalty-free and may be copied, distributed, modified and used without the permission of the Rijksmuseum.". More information on the API: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api.
