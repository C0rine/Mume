### Summary
Mume (MUseum MEmes) is an Android App that uses images from the databases of museums (for this project only the database of the Rijksmuseum is used) to create memes. Based on the popular Facebook-page: https://www.facebook.com/classicalartmemes  

*User gap: to facilitate making and sharing Classical Art Memes.*  
*Underlying idea: introduce art history more into popular-/webculture.*  

Features:
- Search through Rijksmuseum artworks and retrieve individual images of the artworks.
- Edit these images by adding text, drawing on them and/or cropping them.
- Share these images online or with friends through apps already installed on the Android device.
- View the latest memes of the [Classical Art Memes](https://www.facebook.com/classicalartmemes) Facebook page.
