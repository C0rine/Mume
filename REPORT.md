###Short Description
Mume (MUseum MEmes) is an Android App that uses images from the databases of museums (for this project only the database of the Rijksmuseum is used) to create memes. Based on the popular Facebook-page: https://www.facebook.com/classicalartmemes  

*User gap: to facilitate making and sharing Classical Art Memes.*  
*Underlying idea: introduce art history more into popular-/webculture.*  

###Technical Design
**Activities and Adapters**  
- SearchActivity: contains a searchbar to start a search, with below that a RecyclerView with CardViews that hold images from the Facebook page. An adapter (FacebookImagesAdapter) is used to fill the RecyclerView with the items from Facebook.

- ResultsActivity: contains a gridview in which each item has an ImageView (that contains a thumbnail of the searchresult) and a TextView (for the artistname of the searchresult). There is also a searchbar in this activity so the user can quickly make a new search. At the bottom of the Activity are two buttons to navigate between the results-pages. An Adapter (ResultsAdapter) is used to fill the gridview with the searchresults. None of the searchresults are saved to local storage. Everything is cached.

- SelectedActivity: Shows the selected image from the ResultsActivity with below that metadata on the image in a TableLayout. Between the ImageView and the TableLayout is a button that launches the Image Editor.

- Image Editor: Is completely created by the [Adobe SDK](https://creativesdk.adobe.com/). This Image Editing activity gets started from the SelectedActivity. In the intent that launches this activty the image url is put as an extra. The url is used by the SDK to retrieve the image. After editing is done, the Image Editor sends the edited image back to the SelecetedActivity where the user will be asked in a Dialog if they only want to save the image or would also like to share it. The image gets saved to the external storage on the Android Device.

- Share Intent: If the user chooses to share the image, a Share Intent will be launched.

**Classes**  
- ImageRetriever: Makes calls to the collection-image endpoint of the Rijksmuseum API. This class is used in ResultsActivity to get the urls for the thumbnails of the searchresults.
- MyApplication: Used by various classes to get the Application Context. Also used by the Adobe SDK to initialize it.
- Parser: Used by various classes to parse JSONresponses and retrieve specific data from it (i.e. a String[] of artistnames for the ResultsActivity GridView).
- QueryMaker: used to build requesturls which are used to make the networkrequest. Input for the querymaker are searchtype (defining which endpoint of the Rijksmuseum API we want to call) and searchwords (and in the case of the collection endpoint also page number). It returns Strings representing urls.
- VolleySingleton: manages the networksrequest in a queue (we only want one queue, thus it needs to be a singleton). It also manages the loading of images from url (ImageLoader).

**Requirements**  
In order for the app to work correctly there needs to be an internet connection. Every time a http request gets made the connectivity will be checked. If there is no internet connection the user will be notified with a Toast.  

Permissions needed:
- `"android.permission.INTERNET"`: To access the internet.
- `"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"`: To check the state of the internet connection.
- `"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"`: To save the edited image to local storage.


###The Process
**Important Changes and Arguments for the Changes**  
- At the start of the project I wanted to code the image editor myself. In week 3 however I decided not to do this and just use the Adobe SDK. This would save me a lot of time, but also made more sense. The editor of Adobe worked way better then any editor I would code myself. It left me with a lot more time to focus on other things I found important. And gave me time to implement the Facebook API for loading the Facebook images.
- In the first week I had created a UML diagram (see DESIGN.md) with the classes I planned on using. The classes I have eventually created look nothing like the classes in that diagram. One of the main reasons for this is that during the first week I had no idea how Volley worked. Upon implementing Volley it quickly became clear I had to change things drastically (i.e. use the singleton and having to make most of the requests from within the activities). Also the ArtRecord class is completely gone. In week 1 I thought it would be convient to save all the search-results as separate objects. But in the end this did not seem efficient. I actually needed string arrays of the same metadata (i.e. only artistnames) to use in the Adapter to fill the GridView. Also there is no need to save this metadata for long. It just needs to be loaded into views and is not shared between different activities. 
- I thought I would have to merge imagetiles for the thumbnails. Eventually I did not have to do this which saves me a lot of calculations and network requests, but does make the app look less good on for example tablets. (We only use one tile which does show most of the image, but has a low resolution.)
- Eventually there were also some changes I made due to a lack of time:
	- Removed support for landscape orientation
	- I did not plan to use buttons to navigate through the searchresults in the ResultsActivity. I wanted to append new 	searchresults at the bottom of the GridView (instead of a new GridView) when the user scrolled almost to the end of it. But with the limited time left, I decided that for the deadline I would just use the buttons instead.

**Challenges**  
At first both Volley and JSON were very daunting. But after the second week I got the hang of it and the coding became a lot more easy. I was able to quickly implement new functionalities (like the Facebook API). But there were a few things that did take me a lot of time:

It was a hassle to get the thumbnail images in the GridView of the ResultsActivity. It became clear the Rijksmuseum API is not tailored at all for Android. It was very difficult to get an appropriate sized image from the collection-image endpoint (for all issues I ran into see PROCESS.md). The collection-endpoint only returns images of a very high resolution (2000 x 3000 px), way too big to be used as a thumbnail. It would take too much cache space and require enormous (unecessary) network requests (especially for a mobile device). The other option to retrieve images was to use the collection image-endpoint. But this endpoint returns images in separate tiles. I would have had to programmatically combine these tiles to get a full image.  
I struggled with this for many many hours. Eventually I did find a solution, but for this I had to hardcode some dimensions. This does make the app a lot less suitable for example to be used on a tablet. (Solution was to find the smallest level of the image in which the total size was min. 250 x 250 px).

The recycling of the GridView in the ResultsActivity is also something I spend many hours on. The app loads the images mostly correctly but sometimes the views do not get refreshed on a recycle or the old image lingers in the view for a while before being replaced. I mostly solved this with some work arounds, but the way the GridView gets filled first is very spastic (views flying over the screen until all the network requests are complete). To hide this I wanted to use a loading screen, but I could not figure out a way to check if all the requests are done. The problem was that the requests were not being executed on the UI thread and that Volley does not have method to check if the Requestqueue is empty/finished. I have now hardcoded the time the loading screen is displayed, but it would be better ofcourse if the loadingscreen would last until all network requests are done and the UI is loaded.

###Final Solution
The final result is something I am very happy with although not everything looks the way I want it to. The most important aspect for me is that all functionalities are there. Sometimes however I would have liked the UI to behave better (i.e. GridView in ResultsActivity), but this is something I could also work on after the final presentations.
