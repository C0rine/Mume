#Day 1

Made the first sketches of UI (image below) and wrote the proposal (see [README.md](https://github.com/C0rine/Mume/blob/master/README.md)).

I have looked at several apps of museums and meme-generators for inspriration for these preliminary UI designs.

#Day 2
**Tue 5 Jan 2016**  
Started writing the [Design Document](https://github.com/C0rine/Mume/edit/master/DESIGN.md). I did a lot of research into how to implement the Rijkmuseum API and which data I want to retrieve from it. I also looked in more detail at how to code image editing in Android. I came across several things I probably need to add to the app, that I had not though about before:
- Help page
- View random artwork button in the search-activity
- Naming the Rijksmuseum on selected-activity
- Maybe, if there is enough time, also a button to save the edited image to local storage
  
Something I also need to figure out is how I am going to implement multiple pages of seachresults both in coding and in the UI.
